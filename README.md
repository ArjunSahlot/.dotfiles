## Why I made my dotfiles public:
First off, it's definitely not to get other people to use my configuration; my settings work the best for me and would work terribly for you. I mainly put these up for myself when I need to switch computers or frankly anytime I need to refer to them. But, while they won't be useful to you, parts of them might. So another reason I've put these up is to add to the generous community of dotfile-sharers and provide yet another outlet for those config freaks to steal from.
